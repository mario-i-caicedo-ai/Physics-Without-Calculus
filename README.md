# Physics Without Calculus

My plan for this repository is to upload content that I feel might be of
help for anyone -who still lacking Calculus- might show an interest in physics.

The place will obviously be under eternal construction and updating

## Readings

1. [The Unit Circle and Trigonometry](notes/The_Unit_Circle_and_Trigonometry.pdf) This will become handy at some point.
2.  [Motion along a Straight Line](notes/LINEAR-MOTION-I.pdf)
